# helloworld

hello,there!
I have heared about github for long time,but have never written any code with it.
Howver,some shared code or knowledge about JAVa or Python is learned from github,when I am learing related coding knowledge.
Sharing is the best way to learn,I hope can share some usefull knowledge here,with github.
